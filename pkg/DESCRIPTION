Description: Estimate group aggregates, where one can set user-defined conditions
   that each group of records must satisfy to be suitable for aggregation. If
   a group of records is not suitable, it is expanded using a collapsing scheme
   defined by the user. A paper on this package was published in the Journal
   of Statistical Software <doi:10.18637/jss.v112.i04>.
